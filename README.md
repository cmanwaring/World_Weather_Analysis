# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose:
In this module we were tasked with helping Jack with some world weather analysis. We generated random lattitudes and longitudes and then used APIs to find weather conditions and nearby hotels near the coordinates we generated. We then selected four cities from a single country and then used APIs to map directions through all four cities and finishing where we started. And of course we labeled markers for the cities along the way with pertinent information.

## Summary:
This was a fun project that taught us how to use APIs in some real-world scenarios. Being able to get real-time information before running a segment of code means that you can always have reliable data, even if the data changes with the season.
